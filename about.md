In the past buyers of Art deco apartments have gone to some trouble to hide the features, painting over exposed wood, and plastering over ceiling molds. Removing the beautiful stain glass windows, changing the flooring has been a common tactic to contemporize a building. More recently there has been a noticeable shift with renovators looking to hero art deco features, and accentuate the style with furniture choices and art works.

 

The style is becoming so popular that many buyers specific that they are only interested in art deco buildings. Generally, in comparison to modern builds, Art Deco buildings are larger, have higher ceilings, and are often of a better build quality. Often the foyers in apartment buildings are grand with highly polished wooden features, grand carpets and ornate lighting. The exterior design moved away from organic shapes, favoring cubism and geometric shapes. Balconies are a less common feature of art deco buildings, giving the interiors an almost New York living style. 

 

Another style that is common and prized around certain Eastern Suburbs enclaves including Bondi Beach is P&O, a style taking its name from Ocean Liners of the time. The key features of these buildings while keeping with some traditional art deco styles, are often rounded facades, rendered and at times brightly colored to set them well apart. P&O has also gathered a strong following and are reminiscent of a time gone by.

In many of the above-mentioned suburbs developers have noticed these trends, many are building apartments to echo these features in a modern way. In Potts Pont ‘[The Hensley’](https://www.domain.com.au/news/new-apartment-development-the-hensley-brings-art-deco-elegance-back-to-potts-point-20160607-gpdcr1/) has been hailed as the new development to bring back art deco elegance to Potts Point. The Hampton only just up the road was a development that many believe started the trend. In Double Bay, the $100 million dollar Development ‘[1788 Residences](http://www.1788doublebay.com.au)’ saw the record price for a double Bay apartment of $13.75 million. The development as well as all of its marketing takes its cues from the Art Deco style, while having a modern open plan feeling.
